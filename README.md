# No-Snooze-Zone
Most of us face a common problem of over sleeping , not getting up on time which results in rush in the beginning of the day. We have developed our project. When the alarm starts ringing, user has to wake up straight and stand on a vibrating platform. After 10 seconds of standing on the vibrating mat user is fully awake and alarm stops ringing.
